		</header>
		<section>
		<p>
		This platform has been developed over a long-term collaboration between the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Department of Science and Methods for Engineering) and Telecom Italia Lab. The platform provides a number of methods to visualize and extract information from PLS/CDR data. <b>Select the operation you want to execute from the top menu bar</b>.  
		
		<ul style="margin-left:10px;">
		<li><b>General.</b> contains operations to see data coverage and explore basic data properties.</li>
		<li><b>Event Op.</b> contains operations to estimate attendance to events happening in the city.</li>
		<li><b>User Op.</b> contains operations to track individual (anonymized) users and automatically extract important places and routine behaviors.</li>
		</ul>
		
		This code is for demonstration-only purpose. Most of the ideas, algorithms and code have been developed by <a href="http://www.agentgroup.unimo.it/mamei.html"><b>Marco Mamei</b></a>.
